/** \brief Controller-Mode State Machine
 *
 * The controller has multiple states, mostly during boot time.
 * Initially it is set to INVALID_RC, meaning no RC signal was ever read.
 * Once a signal was received, the state changes to NOT_NEUTRAL_AT_STARTUP in case
 * the stick is not in neutral. This would usually indicate a misconfiguration, wrong stick, wrong receiver, wrong neutral point etc.
 * The mode remains at NOT_NEUTRAL_AT_STARTUP until the stick is brought into the neutral range, then
 * the mode is OPERATIONAL.
 * Using the programming switch on the RC sender (see $i command) the user toggles between OPERATIONAL and PROGRAMMING.

/** \brief Monitoring info how the cablecam can be moved currently
 *
 * Normally the CableCam can be moved FREEly, meaning the stick fully controls the cable cam.
 * If the CableCam-mode is one where the endpoint switches are active and there is the danger to
 * overshoot the endpoints, the program does engage the brakes and this monitor reflects the state
 * by setting it to ENDPOINTBRAKE.
 * In case of an emergency, signal loss, CableCam runs away, software fault,... the ESC is set to neutral
 * as last operation and the monitor state is EMERGENCYBRAKE.

 * add new fields at the end of the structure and to never remove a field.
 * Also in the main.c the default values have to be set at two places.
